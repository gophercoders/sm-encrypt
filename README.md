## GopherCoders.com Caesar Cipher Encryption Program

This program encrypts one word according to the [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

The program is incomplete. The pupils will need to complete it according to
the instructions within the program before it will work.

Encrypting more than one one word is a trivial extension that can be worked
